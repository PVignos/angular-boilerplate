## ðŸ’¡ Work in Progress

### SEO URL
- [ ] Research and determine the best practices for implementing SEO-friendly URLs based on translations. For example: `en/about-us`, `it/chi-siamo`.

- [ ] Ensure that accessing `http://localhost:4200/it/dsaasd` displays a *Page not found* message without performing a redirect.

### Automatic Prerendering of Routes
- [ ] Explore solutions for generating prerendered routes automatically, possibly using Node.js and `app.routes.ts` for route extraction.
